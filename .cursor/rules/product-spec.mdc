# Product Vision
- Build a Claude/Codex-style workflow runner for non-dev work.
- Users define Tasks and Workflows that produce concrete Deliverables (docs/sheets/emails/files).
- System executes specs with agents, streams progress, stores outputs as artifacts, and supports review → comment → rerun.

# Core Objects
- Task: reusable definition with executionSpec, deliverablesSpec, contextSpec, mountsSpec.
- Workflow: versioned program template (`workflow_versions`) for immutable runs.
- Run: execution instance pinned to programText+hash, executionSpec snapshot, permissions allowlist, run_files.
- Artifact: output stored by content ref (object storage), linked to runs.

# Rerun Modes
- Replay: exact pinned program/spec for reproducibility.
- Latest: newest task/workflow settings for iteration.

# Execution Guarantees
- Pinned inputs define determinism: programHash+text, executionSpec snapshot, permissions, files.
- Signed manifest ensures tamper resistance in transit.

# Positioning (One-Liner)
- Workflow OS for business tasks: define tasks with tools/integrations, run agents for deliverables, review/comment/rerun until perfect.
